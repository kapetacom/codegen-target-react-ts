- You are coding Typescript using the React UI framework
- When calling async functions, you must use the `await` keyword
- If calling async functions in a react hook, use the useAsync and useAsyncRetry hooks from the `react-use` library
- Whenever doing async operations like loading, saving or sending data, show a loading indicator to the user
- Always use named exports for components, functions and hooks
- The component name should be the same as the file name
