//#FILENAME:src/browser/routes.tsx:create-only
{{ai-type 'web-router'}}
import React from "react";

{{#ai-comment}}

Import the screen components and add routes for each. For example:

import { LoginScreen } from './screens/LoginScreen';
import { SignupScreen } from './screens/SignupScreen';
import { DashboardScreen } from './screens/DashboardScreen';
import { ApplicationScreen } from './screens/ApplicationScreen';

Implement the routes as an array of objects for react-router-dom data routers, e.g. below:
{{/ai-comment}}
export const routes = [
  {
    path: "/login",
    element: <LoginScreen />,
  },
  {
    path: "/signup",
    element: <SignupScreen />,
  },
  {
    path: "/",
    // shell component for the authenticated part of the app
    element: <ApplicationScreen />,
    children: [
      // routes for the authenticated part of the app, usually anything thats not signup or login
      {
        path: '',
        index: true,
        element: <DashboardScreen />
      },
    ],
  },
];
